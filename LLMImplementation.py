a description of each technology and its known vulnerabilities. The report should be
at most 1 pragraph long for each technology. After that create a listing structure
describing potential vulnerabilities for the domain {domain_data['domain']} which 
belongs to the company Aprender-Salud. Each vulnerability mentioned should be listed
